To start, go to the \"My Courses\" tab and add any classes you're in. From there, you can look at your classes by clicking on them, where you'll get a short description as well as a list of the current study groups. Then, you can select any of these groups to join, or create your own. These will then show up in you \"My Study Groups\" tab, where you can tap on the group to see all of the users that are also members. Have fun!"
