To start, go to the \"My Courses\" tab and add any classes you're in. From there, you can look at your classes by clicking on them, where you'll get a short description as well as a list of the current study groups. Then, you can select any of these groups to join. These will show up in you \"My Study Groups\" tab. Have fun!"
